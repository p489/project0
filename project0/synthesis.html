            <u><i><h2 style="color:firebrick">PHYSICAL METHODS</h2></i></u>
            <p style="text-emphasis: height 1.2px">
                There are various physical methods by which synthesis of nanoparticles can be done. Top-down approach,
                where synthesis is initialized
                with the bulk counterpart that leaches out systematically bit-after-bit leading to the generation of
                fine nanoparticles.
                Physical methods apply mechanical pressure, high energy radiations, thermal energy or electrical energy
                to cause material abrasion,
                melting, evaporation or condensation to
                generate nanoparticles. These methods mainly operate on top-down strategy and are
                advantageous as they are free of solvent contamination and produce uniform mono
                disperse nanoparticles. At the same time, the abundant waste produced during the
                synthesis makes physical processes less economical.
            </p>
            
            <p>High energy ball milling, laser ablation, electro spraying, inert gas
                condensation, physical vapour deposition, laser pyrolysis, flash spray pyrolysis, melt
                mixing are some of the most regularly used physical methods to generate nanoparticles. Some of the
                physical methods are discussed
                below: </p>
            <h3 style="color:red;text-shadow: 2px 1px rgb(179, 190, 17);padding:3px">Mechanical Milling</h3>
            <p>The early Nano materials were made by a simple method called ball milling. The fundamental principle of
                size reduction in mechanical
                attrition devices lies in the energy imparted to the sample during impacts between the milling media.
                During this process the
                particles are trapped between two colliding balls within a space occupied by mass of powder particle.
            </p>
            <p>
                High energy ball milling (HEBM), first developed by John Benjamin in 1970 to
                synthesize oxide dispersion strengthened alloys capable of withstanding high
                temperature and pressure, is a robust and energy efficient synthesis method to generate
                nanoparticles with varying shapes and dimensionalities. In high energy ball milling
                process, the moving balls transfer their kinetic energy to the milled material. This
                results in the breaking of their chemical bonds and rupturing of the milled materials
                into smaller particles with newly created surfaces.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, surfactant assisted high energy ball milling is used as an efficient
                strategy for the synthesis of NPs with precise size and specific surface characteristics
                (Fig. 2b). Surfactants are the surface active agents containing both hydrophobic and
                hydrophilic properties and can be classified as anionic, cationic, zwitterionic and
                nonionic depending upon the surface charge characteristics of their hydrophilic group.
            </p>
            <h3 style="color:seagreen; text-shadow: 1px 1px hotpink;padding: 2px;">Laser Ablation</h3>
            <p>Laser ablation is the thermal or nonthermal process of removing atoms from a solid by irradiating
                it with an intense continuous wave (CW) or pulsed laser beam. As one of the most important techniques
                for material processing, laser ablation can be used for drilling extremely small, deep holes through
                very hard materials such as metals or diamonds, producing thin films or nanoparticles, preparing
                material
                surface in a micro- and nano-controlled fashion, and so on.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
                When a solid surface is irradiated by a CW laser beam or long-pulsed (e.g., nanoseconds pulsed) laser
                beam,
                the material is heated by the absorbed laser energy. The thermal motion of some particles is
                accelerated. Once
                the absorbed energy exceeds the sublimation energy, these particles evaporate or sublimate and become
                vaporized
                particles; that is, part of the target is ablated.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, for a short-pulsed laser (e.g., femtosecond laser), the laser-material interaction time is very
                short. Thus,
                the heat energy has no time to diffuse in lattice. The irradiated zone of the material quickly reaches
                vaporization
                temperature and the ablated particles evaporate from the surface. The duration time of the pulse is much
                less than the
                time taken by excited molecules, atoms, and electrons to release heat energy by moving or rotating
                motion
                (i.e., electron–phonon relaxation time), which is too short for linear absorption processes such as the
                single-photon process, electron–phonon interaction process, and thermal diffusion process to happen.
                Consequently, nonlinear absorption of laser energy (e.g., multiple-photon process) does occur during
                short-pulsed laser ablation. The short-pulse laser process is a nonthermal melting process.

                Nanoparticles can be synthesized by various chemical process which happens via <b>nucleation and
                    growth</b> process. Solid-phase synthesis is a method in which molecules are covalently bound on a
                solid support
                material and synthesised step-by-step in a single reaction vessel utilising selective protecting group.
               <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleation" target="_blank"><b>Nucleation </b></a>is the phenomenon of
                initiation of formation of the first nanocrystals in the
                solution. It involves
                the appearance of very small particles or nuclei of the new phase which are capable of growing.
            </p>
            <p>There are two types of nucleation:</p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Homogenous-nuclei</b> form simultaneously and uniformly throughout the solution.</li>
                    <li><b>Heterogenous-nuclei:</b> Nucleated at different time.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Nucleation plays an important role in controlling the properties of the final product, size distribution
                and
                nature of phase. Highly monodisperse nanoparticles are formed if the process of nucleation and growth
                can be
                successfully separated.<b>Growth</b> is basically increasing the size of the pre-existing structure.

            <h3 style="color:rgb(179, 190, 17)"><b>Sol-gel Synthesis</b></h3>
            <p>
                Sol-gel is a methodology of producing small particles in material chemistry.
                It is mostly used for the synthesis of metal oxides. The initial step of this process is
                converting monomers or the starting material into a sol, i.e., a colloidal solution which
                is the precursor for the further formation of a gel. This gel is made up of discrete
                particles or polymers. Most commonly used precursors are chlorides or metal
                alkoxides. These precursors are hydrolysed and poly condensed for the formation of
                colloids. Sol-gel process is preferred due to its economical feasibility and the
                low-temperature process which gives us control over the composition of the product
                achieved. Small amounts of dopants like rare earth elements and organic dyes can be
                used in the sol which homogeneously disseminates in the product formed finally. The
                synthesized product is used as an investment casting material in the processing and
                manufacture of ceramics. Thin metal oxide films can also be produced using this for
                further uses.

                Sol or colloidal solution is a solution where distribution of particles of the size ~<b> 0.1-1
                    <i>micro-metre</i></b> takes place in a liquid in which the only suspending force is the Brownian
                motion.
                A gel is formed when solid and liquid phases are dispersed in each other. In this
                process, initially, colloidal particles are dispersed in a liquid forming a sol. Deposition
                of this sol can produce thin coating on any substrate by the means of spraying, spinning
                or coating. The particles in the sol are left to polymerize by removing the stabilizing
                components and further produce a complex network gel. </p>
            <p>The remaining organic and
                inorganic components pyrolyze in the end by heat treatments to form amorphous or
                crystalline coatings. Sol-gel comprises of two major reactions: alcoholic group
                hydrolysis and its condensation. Precursor sol which is obtained can be given a desired
                shape using appropriate casting container. It can also be deposited on a substrate to
                form a film by dip coating or spin coating or used to synthesize microsphere or
                nanosphere powders. The steps involved in the sol-gel synthesis are Mixing, Casting,
                Gelation, Aging, Drying and Densification.

            <h2 style="color:darkslateblue">Hydrothermal Synthesis</h2>
            <p>This method is used to fabricate NPs of metal oxide, iron oxide and lithium iron
                phosphate keeping control over the characteristics of particles by varying the properties
                of near or supercritical water by using different pressure and temperature conditions.
                It can be performed in two types of systems, the batch hydrothermal or continuous
                hydrothermal process.</p>
            <p> The former is able to carry out a system with the desired ratio
                phases while the latter allows a higher rate of reaction to be achieved at a shorter period
                of time. In a chemical solution, nanoparticles are produced from a colloidal system that
                consists of two or more phases (solid, liquid or gas states) of matter (e.g. gels and
                30
                foams) mixed together under controlled pressure and temperature. The advantage
                of using this method includes the capability to synthesize a huge amount of NPs with
                an optimized size, morphology, composition and surface chemistry that is rationally
                inexpensive. Hydrothermal is a facile and fast process for the synthesis of NPs of
                various other materials such as CoFe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, Ag, FeWO<sub>4</sub>,etc.
