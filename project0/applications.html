       materials.As nanomaterials have exclusive, advantageous physical, chemical, and mechanical properties, they can be applied
        in a host of applications including, but not limited to, those listed below.

 <h2 style="color:greenyellow; padding:5px"><u>Phosphors for High-Definition TV</u></h2>
 <p>Nanocrystalline zinc selenide, cadmium sulfide, zinc sulfide, and lead telluride prepared through the
     sol-gel methods are potential materials for enhancing the resolution of monitors. The use of nanophosphors 
     is intended to lower the cost of these displays to make personal computers and high-definition televisions (HDTVs)
      affordable for an average household.</p>
      <p>The resolution of a monitor or television is subject to the size of the pixel. These pixels are fundamentally
          composed of materials known as “phosphors,” which glow when struck by a stream of electrons within the cathode 
          ray tube (CRT). The resolution enhances with a reduction in the pixel size or the phosphors.</p>


<h2 style="color: goldenrod; padding:5px;"><u>Next-Generation Computer Chips</u></h2>

<p>
   The microelectronics sector has paid special attention to miniaturization, which involves reducing the size of 
   circuits like transistors, capacitors, and resistors. A considerable reduction in their size enables microprocessors
    developed using these parts, to operate much faster, thus allowing computations at much greater speeds.
</p>
<p>
   Nanomaterials help the industry to overcome these obstacles by offering manufacturers materials with better 
   thermal conductivity, nanocrystalline starting materials, ultra-high-purity materials, and longer-lasting, durable 
   interconnections (connections between different parts in the microprocessors).
</p>
<p>
   However, there are a number of technical obstacles to achieving these advancements, such as the lack of ultrafine
    precursors to make these parts, inadequate dissipation of huge amounts of heat generated by these microprocessors 
    because of faster speeds, poor mean time to failures (poor reliability), etc.
</p>

<h2 style="color:indigo;padding:6px"><u>Low-Cost Flat-Panel Displays</u></h2>
<p>In the laptop (portable) computer industry, the demand for flat-panel displays is high. Japan is leading in this area, mainly
    due to its R&D efforts on the materials for these displays.</p>

  <p> The resolution of these display devices can be significantly improved by synthesizing nanocrystalline phosphors, 
   while considerably bringing down the manufacturing costs. Furthermore, the flat-panel displays manufactured using
    nanomaterials have far higher contrast and brightness compared to the traditional ones due to their improved magnetic
     and electrical properties.</p>

 <h2 style="color:lightcoral; padding:6px"><u>Automobiles with Greater Fuel Efficiency</u></h2>    
 <p>
   Existing automobile engines waste substantial amounts of gasoline, thus adding to environmental pollution by burning
    the fuel incompletely. A traditional spark plug is not made to burn the gasoline totally and efficiently. This problem
     is amplified by faulty, or worn-out, spark plug electrodes.
 </p>
<p>
   Since nanomaterials are harder, stronger, and considerably more erosion-resistant and wear-resistant, they are currently being
    proposed for use as spark plugs.
    These electrodes extend the service life of the spark plugs and help burn fuel far more efficiently and fully. A totally new
     spark plug design known as the “railplug” is also in the prototype stage.
</p>

<p>By contrast, railplugs made of nanomaterials are much more long-lasting than even the traditional spark plugs. Furthermore,
    automobiles waste substantial amounts of energy by losing the thermal energy produced by the engine. This is particularly 
    true with diesel engines. Hence, plans have been proposed to coat the engine cylinders (liners) with nanocrystalline ceramics,
     such as alumina and zirconia, so that they preserve heat in a more efficient manner, thus ensuring full and efficient fuel 
     combustion.</p>
<p>
   This railplug applies the technology derived from the “railgun”—a spin-off of the famous Star Wars defense program.
    However, these railplugs produce much stronger sparks (with an energy density of almost 1 kJ/mm<sup>2</sup>). Hence, traditional 
    materials erode and corrode very quickly, and quite often are not of any practical use in automobiles.
