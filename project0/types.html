        <p>When a material is changed from a micro to nano level a whole lot of it's properties
           gets changed. On the nano-level the ratio of surface to volume is larger which causes
           increase in the catalytic properties of the material and is also responsible for it's
           physical change.

        Quantam effects can begin to dominate over the nanoscale level.

            <p>
                Fullerenes are theoritically speaking is an allotrope of carbon <i>graphene</i> rolled into spheres or
                tubes.
                The first fullerene molecule to be discovered, and the family's namesake, buckminsterfullerene (C<sub>60</sub>), was
                prepared in
                1985 by Richard Smalley, Robert Curl, James Heath, Sean O'Brien, and Harold Kroto at Rice University. The
                name was a
                homage to Buckminster Fuller, whose geodesic domes it resembles. Fullerenes have since been found to occur
                in nature.

                    <b>Buckminsterfullerene</b>  
                    Buckminsterfullerene is the smallest fullerene molecule containing pentagonal and hexagonal rings in
                    which no two pentagons share an edge (which can be destabilizing, as in pentalene). It is also most
                    common
                    in terms of natural occurrence, as it can often be found in soot.
                    The empirical formula of buckminsterfullerene is C<sub>60</sub> and its structure is a truncated
                    icosahedron,
                    which resembles an association football ball of the type made of twenty hexagons and twelve pentagons,
                    with a carbon atom at the vertices of each polygon and a bond along each polygon edge.

                    <b>Other fullerenes</b>
                    Another fairly common fullerene has empirical formula C<sub>70</sub>.
                    Heterofullerenes have heteroatoms substituting carbons in cage or tube-shaped structures. They were
                    discovered
                    in 1993 and greatly expand the overall fullerene class of compounds. Notable examples include boron,
                    nitrogen
                    (azafullerene), oxygen, and phosphorus derivatives.

            <div>
                <p> The good example of the fullerene is the carbon nanotubes, they are known for their high conductivity
                    and mechanical strength.
                    Fullerenes are mainly used in the medical field as they are known for binding certain types of
                    antibiotics to the structure
                    of resistant bacteria. They are also found to be resistant against melanoma, at type of cancer cell. All
                    these are possible
                    only because of the good physical and chemical properties of fullerenes. They are also known for their
                    high resistance and
                    superconductivity properties. Thus, they also find great applications as light-activated antimicrobial
                    agents. </p>
            </div>
         
            <p><b>Fullerenes</b> are obtained by passing large amount of electricity between the two graphite electrodes
                which are
                very close to each other in an inert environment.
                Fom the reaction a carbon plasma arc is obtained between the electrodes which then forms a residue from
                which the fullerenes are
                seperated and obtained.</p>

                The rate of production of carbon nanotubes is more than <b><i>100 tons</i></b> per year.
    
                If you think that it is a huge production, you should not: the nanoparticles of silica and
                silicon dioxide are produced in volume more than <b><i>100000 tons</i></b> per year.

                Nanoparticles are made from metals, semiconductors and other particles which have great physical and
                chemical properties. Actually it lies
                between the bulk matter and molecular matter so it have properties of both.
            </p>
            <p>To know the special properties of nanoparticles, let us compare the bending if bulk copper with that of
                copper nanoparticles.
                If bulk copper is bent, the movement of copper atoms/clusters is approximated to be at the 50 nm scale. At
                the same time, copper
                nanoparticles which have sizes below 60 nanometres will not have the same ductility like bulk copper. Also,
                when the size
                decreases, they are known to be very hard.</p>
    
            <p>
                Different types of techniques are employed to characterize the nanoparticles. The most different assessment
                is in finding
                the size characteristics. Most of the nanoparticles that are expected to be in the nanometre range actually
                aggregated in
                solutions. Even light scattering method, ultrasound attenuation spectroscopy, and so on are used to
                determine the size and
                also for knowing the concentrated nano-dispersions.
            </p>
            <p>They are further divided into:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Metal-based nanoparticles:Inorganic nanomaterials, (e.g. quantum dots, nanowires and nanorods) because
                    of their interesting optical and electrical
                    properties, could be used in optoelectronics.[26] Furthermore, the optical and electronic properties of
                    nanomaterials which
                    depend on their size and shape can be tuned via synthetic techniques. There are the possibilities to use
                    those materials in
                    organic material based optoelectronic devices such as Organic solar cells, OLEDs etc. </li>
                <li>One-D nanostructure:The smallest possible crystalline wires with cross-section as small as a single atom
                    can be engineered
                    in cylindrical confinement. Carbon nanotubes, a natural semi-1D nanostructure, can be used as a template
                    for synthesis. </li>
                <li>
                    Two-D nanostructure:They are crystalline materials consisting of a two-dimensional single layer of
                    atoms. The most
                    important representative graphene was discovered in 2004. Thin films with nanoscale thicknesses are
                    considered
                    nanostructures, but are sometimes not considered nanomaterials because they do not exist separately from
                    the
                    substrate.
                </li>
                <li>Bulk structured nanoparticles:Some bulk materials contain features on the nanoscale, including
                    nanocomposites,
                    nanocrystalline materials, nanostructured films, and nanotextured surfaces.
                    Box-shaped graphene (BSG) nanostructure is an example of 3D nanomaterial. BSG nanostructure has appeared
                    after mechanical
                    cleavage of pyrolytic graphite.
