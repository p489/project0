    <p> Nanotechnology (or "nanotech") is manipulation of matter on an atomic, molecular, and supramolecular scale.
        The earliest, widespread description of nanotechnology referred to the particular technological goal of
        precisely manipulating atoms and molecules for fabrication of macroscale products, also now referred to as
        molecular
        nanotechnology.</p>
    <img src="https://cdn.openpr.com/Q/7/Q70553097_g.jpg" style="float:right">
    <p>A more generalized description of nanotechnology was subsequently established by the National Nanotechnology
        Initiative, which defines nanotechnology as the manipulation of matter with at least one dimension sized from 1
        to 100
        nanometers.</p>

    <p> This definition reflects the fact that quantum mechanical effects are important at this quantum-realm scale,
        and so the definition shifted from a particular technological goal to a research category inclusive of all types
        of research
        and technologies that deal with the special properties of matter which occur below the given size threshold. It
        is therefore
        common to see the plural form "nanotechnologies" as well as "nanoscale technologies" to refer to the broad range
        of research
        and applications whose common trait is size.</p>


    <p>Nanotechnology as defined by size is naturally very broad, including fields of science as diverse as surface
        science, organic
        chemistry, molecular biology, semiconductor physics, energy storage, microfabrication, molecular engineering,
        etc.
        The associated research and applications are equally diverse, ranging from extensions of conventional device
        physics to
        completely new approaches based upon molecular self-assembly, from developing new materials with dimensions on
        the
        nanoscale to direct control of matter on the atomic scale.

        One nanometer (nm) is one billionth, or 10<sup>-9</sup>, of a meter. By comparison, typical carbon-carbon bond
        lengths, or
        the spacing between these atoms in a molecule, are in the range 0.12–0.15 nm, and a DNA double-helix has a
        diameter
        around 2 nm. On the other hand, the smallest cellular life-forms, the bacteria of the genus Mycoplasma, are
        around 200 nm
        in length. </p>
    <p>
        By convention, nanotechnology is taken as the scale range 1 to 100 nm following the definition used by the
        National Nanotechnology Initiative in the US. The lower limit is set by the size of atoms (hydrogen has the
        smallest
        atoms, which are approximately a quarter of a nm kinetic diameter) since nanotechnology must build its devices
        from
        atoms and molecules. The upper limit is more or less arbitrary but is around the size below which phenomena not
        observed
        in larger structures start to become apparent and can be made use of in the nano device
    </p>

    <h2 style="color:royalblue">Larger to smaller: a materials perspective</h2>
    <p>
        Several phenomena become pronounced as the size of the system decreases. These include statistical mechanical
        effects
        , as well as quantum mechanical effects, for example the "quantum size effect" where the electronic properties
        of solids
        are altered with great reductions in particle size. This effect does not come into play by going from macro to
        micro
        dimensions. However, quantum effects can become significant when the nanometer size range is reached, typically
        at
        distances of 100 nanometers or less, the so-called quantum realm. </p>

    <p>There are lots of research going on based of nanotechnology in the field of biological science,at industrial
        level,etc.</p>

    <p>Additionally, a number of physical (mechanical,
        electrical, optical, etc.) properties change when compared to macroscopic systems. One example is the increase
        in
        surface area to volume ratio altering mechanical, thermal and catalytic properties of materials. Diffusion and
        reactions at nanoscale, nanostructures materials and nanodevices with fast ion transport are generally referred
        to nanoionics. Mechanical properties of nanosystems are of interest in the nanomechanics research. The catalytic
        activity of nanomaterials also opens potential risks in their interaction with biomaterials.

    <h2 style="color:gold">Simple to complex: a molecular perspective</h2>

    <p>
        Modern synthetic chemistry has reached the point where it is possible to prepare small molecules to almost any
        structure.
        These methods are used today to manufacture a wide variety of useful chemicals such as pharmaceuticals or
        commercial polymers.
        This ability raises the question of extending this kind of control to the next-larger level, seeking methods to
        assemble these
        single molecules into supramolecular assemblies consisting of many molecules arranged in a well defined manner.
    </p>

    <p>Such bottom-up approaches should be capable of producing devices in parallel and be much cheaper than top-down
        methods,
        but could potentially be overwhelmed as the size and complexity of the desired assembly increases. Most useful
        structures
        require complex and thermodynamically unlikely arrangements of atoms. Nevertheless, there are many examples of
        self-assembly
        based on molecular recognition in biology, most notably Watson–Crick basepairing and enzyme-substrate
        interactions.</p>

    <h1 style="text-align: center; text-shadow: 1px 1px  gray;">Tools And Technique</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>There are several important modern developments. The atomic force microscope (AFM) and the Scanning Tunneling
        Microscope (STM)
        are two early versions of scanning probes that launched nanotechnology. There are other types of scanning probe
        microscopy.
        Although conceptually similar to the scanning confocal microscope developed by Marvin Minsky in 1961 and the
        scanning acoustic
        microscope (SAM) developed by Calvin Quate and coworkers in the 1970s, newer scanning probe microscopes have
        much higher
        resolution, since they are not limited by the wavelength of sound or light.</p>

    <p>
        Various techniques of nanolithography such as optical lithography, X-ray lithography, dip pen nanolithography,
        electron beam lithography or nanoimprint lithography were also developed. Lithography is a top-down fabrication
        technique where a bulk material is reduced in size to nanoscale pattern.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another group of nanotechnological techniques include those used for fabrication of nanotubes and nanowires,
        those used in semiconductor fabrication such as deep ultraviolet lithography, electron beam lithography, focused
        ion beam machining, nanoimprint lithography, atomic layer deposition, and molecular vapor deposition, and
        further
        including molecular self-assembly techniques such as those employing di-block copolymers. </p>

            The precursors of these techniques preceded the nanotech era, and are extensions in the development of
            scientific advancements rather than techniques which were devised with the sole purpose of creating
            nanotechnology
            and which were results of nanotechnology research.
