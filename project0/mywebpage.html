        <h1>ABOUT MYSELF </h1>
        <p><b>Hello! Hope you are having a good day!!!</b> </p>
        <p>
            My name is Parishi, and I'm from one of the most beautiful country in the world <b><i>India.</i></b> I'm
           currently a student pursuing my under graduation in Bachelor Of Science, Chemistry.
        </p>
        <p>I developed interest in science from the childhood as I was very much fascinated about the stuffs happening
            around
            me on
            daily basis and particularly about the science basically the laws that govern them. As I grew I read about
            <b><i>Chemistry</i></b>
            and from their
            I developed intrest towards it.

        <h2><u>CHEMISTRY</u></h2>
        <p> Chemistry is the study of matter, its properties, how and why substances combine or separate to form other
            substances, and how
            substances interact with energy. Many people think of chemists as being white-coated scientists mixing
            strange
            liquids in a
            laboratory, but the truth is we are all chemists. Understanding basic chemistry concepts is important for
            almost
            every profession.
            Chemistry is part of everything in our lives.</p>

        <p> Every material in existence is made up of matter â€” even our own bodies. Chemistry is involved in everything
            we
            do,
            from growing and cooking food to cleaning our homes and bodies to launching a space shuttle. Chemistry is
            one of
            the
            physical sciences that help us to describe and explain our world.</p>

        <p>The field of study in which I'm more interested is an integral part of our life i.e. right I'm talking about

                NANOMATERIALS.</span>
            I know that we don't pay attention to this on a daily basis but trust me it makes our life a lot easier. </p>

            <p> Nanomaterials are defined as the substances between the size between 1-100 <i>nm.</i>
                Nanomaterials research takes a material science based approach to nanotechnology, materials at nanoscale
                often have a unique
                optical, electronic or mechanical properties. </p>
